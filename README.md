# Exam Preperation Progress Tracker

## Proposal

An **exam preperation progress tracker application**. This application is supposed to serve as an 
aid to normal class notes and solve the issue of unorganized practice prior to exams.
This application will be able to store exam related information for multiple courses according 
to the user's needs. Particularly for courses that rely heavily on practice problems and past exams, 
this application provides the ability to store practice problems a user has trouble with for further practice as well as give the user the option to input a solution to said problem. The solution will, by default, be hidden, however, can be revealed at the request of the user.
The user will 
also be able to track progress through a status feature which is visibly shown to the user for every problem stored; the three 
statuses are: 
- *Not reviewed*
- *Reviewing*
- *Mastered*. 

With this status feature, there will also be a feature to filter out problems based on which status of problems you want to look out, therefore, users can have more focused study. 

This application will primarily be used by **students**.

This project is of interest to me as I am a big advocate for doing practice problems in preperation for exams; I have also realized 
the importance of recording problems you do not get correct the first time/ don't understand, 
figuring the solutions out yourself, and then studying the solution as the exam dates get closer. However, 
without a good way to organize these tougher problems, I typically resort to screenshotting and pasting 
questions + solutions onto a document for further review; without a way to track my progress on each 
of the problems, I find myself often reviewing more deeply the problems at the top of the document. 
With a feature to filter the various statuses, I think this solves that problem.
